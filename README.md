## Installation

Instructions for all operating systems here:
https://golang.org/doc/install

## Getting started

The best place to begin and for continued reference is the Tour of Go. The site provides excellent explanations of Go's syntax and capabilities. Users can go through exercises in the 'playground' online, or download the program to use on a local machine.

https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1

After going through the tour, see 'Effective Go' for a great write-up of how to use the language eloquently and effectively.

https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html

-- With just these resources for reference, you can do just about anything in Go. 

## Further Resources
